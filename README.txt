Student Result Management - HTML Simulation + Java Console
=======================================================

This package contains two components:
1) index.html - A simple HTML + JavaScript simulation. Open this file in your browser to enter student details and see results instantly (no server required).
2) StudentResultManagementConsole.java - A Java console program that performs the same calculations. Compile and run it using javac/java.

How to use HTML version (Option B - runs in browser):
